# How To: React.js

Simple, modern JavaScript examples of how to create an interactive, stateful webpage using the React.js library.

## Setup and Install

This is a self-contained webpage, there's nothing to install, you just need to preserve this repository's directory structure.

React.js 16.13.1 is currently packaged with this example.

## Run

There's nothing to run or build, if you want to see the rendered HTML, you just need to open the `index.html` file in a contemporary web-browser with JavaScript enabled, or send it through an HTML-to-??? renderer to render in the ??? Format (like PDF, PostScript, PNG, JPG, _etc._).

This page is meant to be interactive, though, so it's best to use a Web-Browser.

If you'd like to use the React devtools extension available for certain browsers, you likely need to host the `index.html` in a local webserver, which can be done very easily with Python v3.x:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

The above should be called after `cd`-ing into this directory with the `index.html` file.
