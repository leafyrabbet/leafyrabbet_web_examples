# How To: Backbone.js

Simple modern JavaScript examples of how to use Backbone.js for templatized HTML generation in an MVC (Model-View-Controller) web-app design.

## Setup and Install

This is a self-contained webpage, there's nothing to install, you just need to preserve this repository's directory structure.

For reference, though it's already included here, it should be noted that `backbone.js` has a hard dependency on `underscore.js`, which needs to be included/imported before including/importing `backbone.js` when creating a new page.

You'll see this in the `index.html` file at these lines:

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="./libs/underscore/underscore.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./libs/backbone/backbone.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./index.js"></script>
```

## Run

There's nothing to run or build, if you want to see the rendered HTML, you just need to open the `index.html` file in a contemporary web-browser with JavaScript enabled.
